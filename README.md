# Project 3 Team 5 - Say Whaaaaaat? Game

Say what is a multiplayer game that people ages 10 and up can enjoy. We created this app to have a bit of fun while being a bit challenging to give your brain some exercise. This is a social game. Users can invite up to 3 other friends to join and play with them!

The app starts with you signing in with your google account and puts you right into your profile showing your stats for this game. Then there is a button available to “Create game.” Click that button and you are almost there. You will be given a URL that you can share with the people you want to join you. Each game can have up to 4 players. Once the link is shared and you go to the URL, you’ll be put into the waiting room until the other players have arrived. Once they have arrived at the game, it will start by having each player spin the wheel once to see who goes first and the game will start. The empty slots will be above showing you what letters have been guessed correct and a keyboard below showing what letters have been guessed incorrectly. The wheel you spun will show you the amount of points you earn for each correct guess. If you wait to long your turn will be forfeited and you will lose 500 points. Once you think you know the phrase when it's your turn press the “guess phrase” button to try and guess the phrase. If correct you receive 100,000, if incorrect you lose all points and start again from 0.

There will also be a messenger on the game play page to poke a bit of fun at your counterparts. Remember to have fun and happy guessing!
